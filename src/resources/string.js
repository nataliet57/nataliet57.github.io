    intro: `I'm currently a second year student  passionate about planning,
    developing, and delivering software solutions. I enjoy learning new things, music, playing sports,
    and meeting new people. I'd love to get in touch with you!`,
    aboutFirst: `I’m particularly fascinated by the fast-paced tech scene that constantly introduces new
    products and ideas. In the past, I’ve mainly worked on programming software projects. I find myself
    obsessed with listening to music while coding, trying to debug a feature, or searching up a quick
    fix on StackOverflow. Since I was a relentless kid, I would spend hours finding a solution to a puzzle,
    or perfecting a new skill. That’s what I enjoy about software development. Oftentimes, I get caught up
    researching a topic, and building a solution which can take quite a bit of time. It will be hours until
    I realize it’s time to take a break and work on it again tomorrow.`,
    aboutSecond: `I love learning new things! One of the reasons why I would like to pursue a career in the
    tech industry is because it relies heavily on team dynamics where every moving part is essential in creating
    the end product. I would love to be more exposed to road mapping the features of a product, as well as designing them.
    As I developed a keen interest in product design and I started by participating in the 30-day design challenge.
    Initially, I observed and analyzed different designs to differentiate what made a design good or bad. Studying
    user experience and reading books about it made me more conscious of the different components that designers would
    often spend hours deciding on. There is no doubt that satisfying people’s needs are no simple task. (The book is
    called The Design of Everyday Things, would highly recommend it!)`,
    aboutConcl: `After a long day of work, I like to kick it back and watch some Netflix. You’ll find me rewatching
    shows like the Office, How I Met Your Mother, and Modern Family. I’m also a huge fan of Money Heist, HunterxHunter,
    and kdramas. I love playing sports: volleyball, badminton, swimming, running, football, tennis, frisbee, snowboarding,
    skiing, those are just a few! Oh yeah, I’m also a photographer and I love sunsets. Check it out `
