						<h3>about me </h3>

							a project due within the next 48 hours.

					<p> <b> Photography & Videography </b></p>
					<p>I've always brought my DSLR to family events, birthday parties, and my instax to simple outngs with my friends. I enjoy capturing
						moments in my life and the reactions of other people towards a certain event. I'm also passionate about videography and video-editing

					<p> <b> Sports </b></p>
					<p> Skiing is just one of the numerous sports I thoroughly enjoy! It always provides me with an exhilarating feeling as I shred 
						the snow and I swerve side-to-side. That's just one of the sports I participate during the winter. I also play basketball, 
						volleyball, badminton, ultimate frisbee, softball, swim, and run. Sports are a way of expressing myself as well as relieving my stress. </p>

					<b> Travelling </b>
					<p> Travcelling has always opened up my mind to different cultures, foods, and people. As someone who enjoys learning, travelling 
						has been one of the easiest ways to do so: whether it be learning about their history or their lifestyle. I've travelled to Japan, 
					Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Spain, Germany, and Chicago. I'd definitely love to explore new places in the years to come! </p>
