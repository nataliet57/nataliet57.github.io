					<p> <b> Photography & Videography </b></p>
					<p>My passion for photography and videography started when I was 15 years old. It started with simple vlogs every

							and on every memorable occasion. I'm currently working on a 1-second-everyday video as well as a collection of 
							videos of events that happened in 2019. You can visit my youtube channel by scrolling to the bottom of this site.  </p>

					<p> <b> Sports </b></p>
					<p> Skiing is just one of the numerous sports I thoroughly enjoy! It always provides me with an exhilarating feeling as I shred 
						the snow and I swerve side-to-side. That's just one of the sports I participate during the winter. I also play basketball, 
						volleyball, badminton, ultimate frisbee, softball, swim, and run. Sports are a way of expressing myself as well as relieving my stress. </p>
